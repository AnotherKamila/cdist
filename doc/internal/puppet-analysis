## What do I need [from puppet?]

### Abstraction of package managers

I don't want to care about apt, rpm, yum, pacman, etc. I just
want to ensure, some package exists or does not exist.


### Common tasks already done

   - [LIBRARY] All the helper types like 
      - file
      - ssh_keys
      - package
      - service
      - user

### PORTABILITY
   - [PORTABILITY] clients for every unix
      - mostly ruby + facter in puppet

### Other
   - Modules: Nice to put stuff together
      - and reuse
   - [CONDITIONS] facter is cool
   - the DSL
      - with many bugs
   - templates
   - Client/Server approach is nice to have
      - Clients only get the part of the documentation, that's
        relevant to them
   - detect impossible/unsafe things:
      - creating a file twice
      - installing and removing a package
      - and report location of occurence
         - parse afterwards?

what is puppet? [FOR ME]

   A configuration deployment assistant,
   a DSL that allows you define the objectives.
   A webserver with fileserver capabilities.
   A client based scheduled polling infrastructure.

What do I miss from puppet?

   - speed
   - elegance
   - clean design
   - documentation
   - the "no surprise" factor
   - easy to use "data memory" (i.e. external ressources)
   - easy integration into installation process
      - copy identity to master
   - multi master setups
   - development configurations / tests
   - editing of configuration files
      - similar to cfengine
   - replace bug squasher with bug avoidance
      - qmail did not need one either
   - push infrastructure
   - real / meaningful error messages
