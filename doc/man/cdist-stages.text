NAME
----
cdist-stages - Stages used during configuration deployment


DESCRIPTION
-----------
Starting the execution of deployment with cdist-deploy-to(1), cdist passes
through different stages, each can be triggered and debugged on its own.
Reading the source of the cdist-deploy-to executable shous the scripts
responsible for each stage.


STAGE 0: INTERNAL PREPERATION
-----------------------------
Before running the user facing stages, cdist prepares the target host
to contain cdist binaries and creates a clean environment for the
configuration run.

   - cdist-bin-transfer(1)


STAGE 1: TARGET INFORMATION RETRIEVAL
--------------------------------------
In this stage information is collected about the target host using so called
explorers. Every existing explorer is run on the target and the output of all 
explorers are copied back into the local cache. The results can be used by 
manifests and types.

   - cdist-explorer(7)


STAGE 2: RUN THE INITIAL MANIFEST
---------------------------------
The initial manifest, which should be used for mappings of hosts to types,
is executed. This stage creates objects in a cconfig database that contains
the objects as defined in the manifest for the specific host. In this stage,
no conflicts may occur, i.e. no object of the same type with the same id may
be created.

   - cdist-manifest-run-init(1)
   - cdist-manifest(7)
   - cdist-config-layout(7)


STAGE 3: EXECUTION OF TYPES
---------------------------
Every object is checked whether its type has a manifest file. If the type has
a manifest file and it is executable, it will be executed. The manifest script
may generate and change the created objects. In other words, one type can reuse
other types.

For instance the object __apache/www.test.ch is of type __apache, which may 
contain a manifest script, which creates new objects of type __file.

The newly created objects are merged back into the existing tree. No conflicts
may occur during the merge. A conflict would mean that two different objects
try to create the same object, which indicates a broken configuration.

   - cdist-manifest-run-all(1)


STAGE 4: CODE GENERATION
------------------------
In this stage for every created objects its type is checked whether it has a
gencode script. If the type has a gencode script and it is executable it will
be executed. This executable should create code to be executed on the target
on stdout. If the gencode executable fails, it must print diagnostic messages
on stderr and exit non-zero.

   - cdist-types-gencode(7)
   - cdist-gencode(1)
   - cdist-gencode-all(1)


STAGE 5: CODE EXECUTION
-----------------------
The resulting code from the previous stage is transferred to the target host
and executed there to apply the configuration changes,

   - cdist-exec-transfer(1)
   - cdist-exec-run(1)


SUMMARY
-------
If, and only if, all the stages complete without an errors, the configuration
will be applied to the target. Each stage can also be run individually, though
dependencies for each stage must be fulfilled and thus the stages must be run
in correct order.
