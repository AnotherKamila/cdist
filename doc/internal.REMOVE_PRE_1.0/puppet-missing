What do I miss from puppet?

   - speed
   - elegance
   - clean design
   - documentation
   - the "no surprise" factor
   - easy to use "data memory" (i.e. external ressources)
   - easy integration into installation process
      - copy identity to master
   - multi master setups
   - development configurations / tests
   - editing of configuration files
      - similar to cfengine
   - replace bug squasher with bug avoidance
      - qmail did not need one either
   - push infrastructure
   - real / meaningful error messages
