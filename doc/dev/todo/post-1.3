Core:
   - write test case: test.sh
   - doc/man/cdist-reference.text.sh: use static version from cdist-config
   - export remote user name -> $__user

Types to be written/extended:
   j __ssh-keys (host/user)
   - __service
   - __file_edit
      - regexp replace (can probably cover all?)
   - __cron
   - __issue: add --source

      - hint: http://protempore.net/~calvins/howto/ssh-connection-sharing/
   - Describe pull architecture and requirements
      - cdist-trigger after first run from /var/lib/cdist/out/bin?
   - Different environments (production, integration, development)
      - via version control
   - Ensure html output of manpages are published on the web
