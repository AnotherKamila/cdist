Core:
   - think about using .cdist for meta information?
      - otherwise: parameter, gencode-local, etc. are not valid object id stuff

Types to be written/extended:
   j __ssh-keys (host/user)
   - __service
   - __file_edit
      - regexp replace (can probably cover all?)
   - __cron

Documentation:
   - Describe Multi master setups
   - use ssh with master socket?
      - saves connection delay for new connections: -M
      - hint: http://protempore.net/~calvins/howto/ssh-connection-sharing/
   - Different environments (production, integration, development)
      - via version control
