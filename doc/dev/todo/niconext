Dependency problem:

Generating  code  for __file/home/lyni/dos/scorch15/SCORCH.DOC ...
scp: /home/lyni/dos/scorch15/SCORCH.DOC: No such file or directory

-> Err, gencode does the wrong thing here.

Gencode is also not very clean, doing stuff that should probably
done later.

Maybe differentiate between local|remote execution?
   -> does not help either if different run

   -> keep dependencies in execute, have local and remote exec?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Possible solution:

   - remove gencode
   - replace with gen_localcode and gen_remotecode
   - run both in the execution stage of the object
