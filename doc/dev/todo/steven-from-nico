- check: echo without parameters == valid in posix? bin/cdist-object-run:45 and others
- align messages (already in todo for steven, but makes life much easier, thus repeated)
- advantage of touch/rm loop vs. y == variable? bin/cdist-object-run-all
    also in bin/cdist-object-run
- bin/cdist-object-run-all: "->" graphic: can be useful, but if -> consistent!
   -> all graphics could look cool:

   Object foo
   |
   |--> Requires ...
   |--> ...

   but maybe bad do parse from outside

- bin/cdist-object-run: type_explorer stuff: probably put into own binary
   - sounds like cdist-object-explorer-run is already the right executable to
      place such stuff into

- remove enormous amount of empty lines :-)
   - at end of file
   - between [ $# -eq 2 ] ||  and set
   - after if
   - before fi

- cdist-type-explorer-push: wherefore if [ -d "$src_dir" ];?
   -> does this not even hide bugs?
   -> not sure whether covering cdist-dir in its own script makes
      sense, as cdist-dir push is only a one liner
      -> if cdist-dir does too less, enhance it

- code aus cdist-object-run-all für requirements:
   in cdist-object-requirements oder so auslagern?
   cdist-object-run-all wäre dann eine schöne zwei-zeiler-schleife

- try to prefix all internal variables with __cdist!
   - only avoid if waayyyyyyyyyyy tooooooooo long
   - f.i.: cdist-object-explorer-run

- cdist-object-explorer-run and bin/cdist-object-run seem to contain
   very very similar code regarding transfer and co.

- cdist-object-manifest-run: 
   # Tell cdist that there may be new objects -> WHO? :-)

- general: cdist-object-run-all looks like a good idea!
