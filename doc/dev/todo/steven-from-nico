- check: echo without parameters == valid in posix? bin/cdist-object-run:45 and others
- align messages (already in todo for steven, but makes life much easier, thus repeated)
- advantage of touch/rm loop vs. y == variable? bin/cdist-object-run-all
    also in bin/cdist-object-run
- bin/cdist-object-run-all: "->" graphic: can be useful, but if -> consistent!
   -> all graphics could look cool:

   Object foo
   |
   |--> Requires ...
   |--> ...

   but maybe bad do parse from outside

- bin/cdist-object-run: type_explorer stuff: probably put into own binary
   - sounds like cdist-object-explorer-run is already the right executable to
      place such stuff into
