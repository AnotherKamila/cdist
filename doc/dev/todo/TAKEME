UNASSIGNED TODOS
----------------
The following list of todos has not been assigned to any developer.
Feel free to pick one!

CORE
----
- Only build manpages if necessary for types as well as for the core!
- Add echo function:
   __cdist_echo [level] [messages...]
      level := syslog alike:
         debug, notice, err
- Think about moving cdist-type-build-emulation out of cdist-manifest-run to
   cdist-deploy-to: more dependency of cdist-manifest-run, but a lot of
   less cycles consumed

TYPES
------
Types to be written/extended:
   - __ssh-keys (host/user)
   - Think about __service - necessary?
   - __file_edit
      - regexp replace (can probably cover all?)
         -> aka sed.
   - __cron

DOCUMENTATION
--------------
- asciidoc interprets __, which we use for variables
  names -> seek through docs and replace with \_\_!
- check all all internal variables are prefixed with __cdist

Cache:
   - add example how to use 
   - export variable $__cache
      -> for current host
      -> add function to cdist-config, import from cdist-cache


remove --preseed from package_apt and add debconf_set_selection or similar
   -> much cleaner!
