Core:
   - write test case: test.sh
   - probably remove grep -q (solaris does not have it)
   - export remote user name -> $__user

Types to be written/extended:
   - __ssh-keys (host/user)
   - __service
   - __file_edit
      - regexp replace (can probably cover all?)
   - __cron
   - __issue: add --source

   - Describe pull architecture and requirements
      - cdist-trigger after first run from /var/lib/cdist/out/bin?
   - Different environments (production, integration, development)
      - via version control
   - Check all references in manpages, ensure all manpages exist
   - Ensure html output of manpages are published on the web
   - ensure every file in bin/ has a correspondent manpage
