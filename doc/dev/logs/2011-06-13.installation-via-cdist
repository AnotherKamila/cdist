Provisioning Server ideas

   - bootup kernel on target host via TFTP/PXE
   - start our code that
      - enables networking (dhcp)
      - enables sshd

Requires:
   - Program that creates our blob that needs to be started
      - for Linux: initrd
      - Including ssh keys -> known!
      - startup sshd
