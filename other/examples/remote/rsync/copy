# Use rsync over ssh to copy files.  This particular invocation of
# rsync makes a backup of the file before overwriting it.  For example,
# if cdist overwrites /etc/passwd then you'll end up with the old copy
# at /etc/passwd~cdist.
#
# Usage:
#  cdist config --remote-copy /path/to/this/script target_host
