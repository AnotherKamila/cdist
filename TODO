         - cdist-types           [IMPORTANT]
         - cdist.text            [IMPORTANT]
      - add terminology
      - define steps within configuration apply
         - detect impossible/unsafe things:
         - creating a file twice
         - installing and removing a package
         - and report location of occurence
         - parse afterwards?
      - multi master setups
      - templating
         - how to define templates
            - variable substitution from shell may be problematic
         - SHELL SCRIPTS! (executables? do not support?)
            - stdout == output of template == what will be used
- cdist-explore
   - add more stuff to explore
   - write manpage
   - save in cache as well
- Create usable Makefile 
   - install
