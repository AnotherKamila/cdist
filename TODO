- doc:
   - cdist manpage (main manpage)
      - cleanup following man + their tree:
         - cdist.text
         - cdist-design.text
      - add terminology
      - define entry point
      - define modules / mix with library?
         - and entry point is my only real configuration?
      - define steps within configuration apply
         - detect impossible/unsafe things:
         - creating a file twice
         - installing and removing a package
         - and report location of occurence
         - parse afterwards?

   - how to define templates
      - variable substitution from shell may be problematic
         - SHELL SCRIPTS! (executables? do not support?)
            - stdout
   - cleanup / integrate doc/man/cdist.text
   - define how to write / provide functions
      - keep generic / easy extension
- cdist-deply-to
   - sync conf/{lib/,modules,host/$name}
- cdist-explore
   - add more stuff to explore
   - write manpage
- cdist-build-explorer| ssh localhost
- Create usable Makefile 
   - install
- to implement (from puppet):
   - package management and different "providers"
   - file / directory handling
   - ssh key handling
   - services
   - user management
      - including passwords
   - integrate "external ressources"
      - probably via explorer
      - what about blobs?
      - what about source = ${host}/.../
- to implement (from cfengine):
   - file editing (sed, awk)
   - huge library of functions shipped by default
   - disconnected clients with "cache"
- release first public version, which includes at least:
   - manpages
   - only do necessary work
         - install packages only if not existent
               - copy file only if different

Before initial release, document:
      
   - how to add package backends
   - how to write a minimal host manifest
   - create library with all functions (and their parameters)
      - cdist_package
      - cdist_file
      - cdist_dir

   - multi master setups
   - pull strategy
