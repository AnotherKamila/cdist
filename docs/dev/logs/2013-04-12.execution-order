Old:

- global explores (all)
- initial manifest
- for each object
    execute type explorers
    execute manifest

    continue until all objects (including newly created)
    have their type explorers/manifests run
- build dependency tree
- for each object
    execute gencode-*
    execute code-*

New:
- run all global explorers
- run initial manifest
    creates zero or more cdist_objects
- for each cdist_object
    if not cdist_object.has_unfullfilled_requirements:
        execute type explorers
        execute manifest
            may create new objects, resulting in autorequirements

            # Gained requirements during manifest run
            if object.has_auto_requirements():
                continue

    cdist_object.execute gencode-*
    cdist_object.execute code-*
