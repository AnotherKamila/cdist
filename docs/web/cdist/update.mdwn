## Update

To upgrade cdist in the current branch use

    git pull

    # Also update the manpages
    ./build man
    export MANPATH=$MANPATH:$(pwd -P)/doc/man

If you stay on a version branche (i.e. 1.0, 1.1., ...), nothing should break.
The master branch on the other hand is the development branch and may not be
working, break your setup or eat the tree in your garden.

### Upgrading from 1.7 to 2.0

* Ensure python (>= 3.2) is installed on the server
* Use "cdist config host" instead of "cdist-deploy-to host"
* Use "cdist config -p host1 host2" instead of "cdist-mass-deploy"
* Use "cdist banner" for fun
* Use **\_\_object_fq** instead of **\_\_self** in manifests

### Upgrading from 1.6 to 1.7

* If you used the global explorer **hardware_type**, you need to change
  your code to use **machine** instead.

### Upgrading from 1.5 to 1.6

* If you used **\_\_package_apt --preseed**, you need to use the new
  type **\_\_debconf_set_selections** instead.
* The **\_\_package** types accepted either --state deinstalled or
  --state uninstaaled. Starting with 1.6, it was made consistently
  to --state removed.

### Upgrading from 1.3 to 1.5

No incompatiblities.

### Upgrading from 1.2 to 1.3

Rename **gencode** of every type to **gencode-remote**.

### Upgrading from 1.1 to 1.2

No incompatiblities.

### Upgrading from 1.0 to 1.1

In 1.1 the type **\_\_file** was split into **\_\_directory**, **\_\_file** and
**\_\_link**. The parameter **--type** was removed from **\_\_file**. Thus you
need to replace **\_\_file** calls in your manifests:

 * Remove --type from all \_\_file calls
 * If type was symlink, use \_\_link and --type symbolic
 * If type was directory, use \_\_directory
