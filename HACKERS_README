Hey hackers,

cdist has not been published, you're accessing a early in developent
code.

Do not believe anything written in cdist, besides what's written in this file
(everything else may be future stuff for the initial release).

What you can do so far: (executed from top level directory)

The following code will get executed if you run this README:

eof

# Tell the user what we do, so this script makes sense during execution
set -x

# prepare use (only from top level directory)
export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd -P)/bin"
export __cdist_config="$(pwd -P)/conf"

object_tmp=/tmp/localhost/objects
explorer_tmp=/tmp/localhost/explorers
exec_tmp=/tmp/localhost/exec


# Test first level manifest execution
cdist-manifest-init localhost "$object_tmp"

# See what it generated
find "$object_tmp"

# Generate all objects, including from types that generate objects as well
cdist-manifest-recursive-all localhost "$object_tmp"

# See what it generated
find "$object_tmp"

# Run explorer on a "remote" host
cdist-explorer-run localhost "$explorer_tmp"

# Display result
find "$explorer_tmp"

# Generate code for all objects in object dir
cdist-object-codegen-all localhost "$object_tmp" "$exec_tmp"

# Display result
find "$exec_tmp"
