Hey hackers,

cdist has not been published, you're accessing a early in developent
code.

Do not believe anything written in cdist, besides what's written in this file
(everything else may be future stuff for the initial release).

## Conventions

- All variables exported by cdist are prefixed with a double underscore (__)
- All cdist-internal variables are prefixed with __cdist_ and are generally not exported.

## Running cdist when developing

This file is suitable for execution and saving the objects and
explorers from cdist. I usually do it like this:

   % rm -rf /tmp/localhost && ./HACKERS_README

################################################################################
eof

# Tell the user what we do, so this script makes sense during execution
set -x

# prepare use (only from top level directory)
export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd -P)/bin"
export __cdist_conf_dir="$(pwd -P)/conf"

export __cdist_local_base_dir=/tmp/localhost

target="${1:-localhost}"
cdist-deploy-to "$target"

find "${__cdist_local_base_dir}"
