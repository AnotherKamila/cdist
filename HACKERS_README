Hey hackers,

cdist has not been published, you're accessing a early in developent
code.

Do not believe anything written in cdist, besides what's written in this file
(everything else may be future stuff for the initial release).

What you can do so far:

# prepare use:
export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd -P)/bin"

# Test first level manifest execution
__cdist_config=$(pwd -P)/conf __cdist_target_host=ikq02.ethz.ch cdist-manifest-init 

# See what it generated
find conf/cache
