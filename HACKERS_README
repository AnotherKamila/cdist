Hey hackers,

cdist has not been published, you're accessing a early in developent
code.

Do not believe anything written in cdist, besides what's written in this file
(everything else may be future stuff for the initial release).

What you can do so far: (executed from top level directory)

The following code will get executed if you run this README,
I usually do it like this:

   % rm -rf /tmp/localhost && ./HACKERS_README

eof

# Tell the user what we do, so this script makes sense during execution
set -x

# prepare use (only from top level directory)
export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd -P)/bin"
export __cdist_config="$(pwd -P)/conf"

# Change paths so we can debug stuff :-)
export __cdist_out_dir=/tmp/localhost

target="${1:-localhost}"
cdist-deploy-to "$target"

find "${__cdist_out_dir}"
