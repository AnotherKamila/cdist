Hey hackers,

cdist has not been published, you're accessing a early in developent
code.

Do not believe anything written in cdist, besides what's written in this file
(everything else may be future stuff for the initial release).

What you can do so far: (executed from top level directory)

# prepare use:
export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd -P)/bin"
object_tmp=/tmp/localhost/objects
explorer_tmp=/tmp/localhost/explorers

# Test first level manifest execution
__cdist_config=$(pwd -P)/conf cdist-manifest-init localhost $object_tmp

# See what it generated
find $object_tmp

# Run explorer on a "remote" host
__cdist_config=$(pwd -P)/conf cdist-explorer-run localhost $explorer_tmp

# Display result
find $explorer_tmp

# Soon working:
__cdist_config=$(pwd -P)/conf cdist-manifest-recursive-run localhost $object_tmp
