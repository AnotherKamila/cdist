can normally be found below ${__cdist_conf_dir}:

${__cdist_explorer_dir}: Contains explorer, which explore the target
${__cdist_manifest_dir}: Contains manifests which define types being used
${__cdist_manifest_init}: The first manifest executed (i.e. cdist entry point)
${__cdist_type_dir}: Contains types
