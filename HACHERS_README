Hey hackers,

cdist has not been published, you're accessing a early in developent
code.

Do not believe anything written in cdist, besides what's written in this file
(everything else may be future stuff for the initial release).

What you can do so far:

# prepare use:
export PATH="$PATH:$(pwd -P)/bin"

## Test config tree wrapper
cd test && ./cdist-cconfig-tree
