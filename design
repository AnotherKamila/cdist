cdist using the push principle (triggered by server)

% server
   cdist-deploy-to <client-hostname>
      cdist-preprocess  # fills up variables with content
         cdist-explore  % client # explores client configuration
      cdist-compile     # parses configuration, creates internal state in cconfig format, verifies
      cdist-link        # uses cconfig output, creates executable
      cdist-transfer    # transfer executable to client
      cdist-execute     % client # execute resulting executable

Operation on the server is run as "cdist" user.
Operation on the client is run as "root" user.

cdist using the pull principle (triggered by client)
% client
   cdist-trigger <server-hostname> # connects to server
      cdist-deploy-to <client-hostname> % server: see above
