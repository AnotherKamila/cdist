x Define how to get information from clients
   x Create shell script that creates code to run on client (cdist-build-explorer)
x Create configuration tree from manifest
   x write binaries, which create the tree when called from manifest (cdist_tree_wrapper)
x Define configuration paths (doc/internal/config-layout)
- redo explorers (see manpage)
/ Write at least one type

   - types?
   - can/may types modify tree?
      - may open door for getting information from manifest / other stuff
