This document defines how to continue work on cdist:

x Define how to get information from clients
   x Create shell script that creates code to run on client (cdist-build-explorer)
x Create configuration tree from manifest
   x write binaries, which create the tree when called from manifest (cdist_tree_wrapper)
- Parse configuration tree
- Generate code to be executed on client
- Cleanup / refactor
