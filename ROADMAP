This document defines how to continue work on cdist:

x Define how to get information from clients
   x Create shell script that creates code to run on client (cdist-build-explorer)
x Create configuration tree from manifest
   x write binaries, which create the tree when called from manifest (cdist_tree_wrapper)
x Define configuration paths (doc/internal/config-layout)
x Redo explorers (see manpage)
/ Write at least one type

- Parse configuration tree/objects recursively
   - can/may types modify tree?
      - may open door for getting information from manifest / other stuff
- generate code to be executed on client
   - check return codes
   - abort on first error?

-> 1.0
