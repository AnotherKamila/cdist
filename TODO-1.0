Steps needed until 1.0:

   x finish type __file
   - finish type __package
   - cleanup documentation (see below)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This document defines how to continue work on cdist:

x general stuff
   x Define configuration paths (doc/internal/config-layout)
   x check whether remote and local view of objects can be the same,
    i.e. local:/outdir == remote:/var/lib/cdist
    x similar, but not the same

x get information from target (stage 1)
   x Define how to get information from targets
      x Create shell script that creates code to run on client (cdist-build-explorer)
   x Redo explorers (see manpage)
x run initial manifest (stage 2)
   x Create configuration tree from manifest
      x write binaries, which create the tree when called from manifest (cdist_tree_wrapper)

x be able to run manifest of types (stage 3)
   x Parse configuration tree/objects recursively
      x can/may types modify tree?
         -> yes, of everything a type created itself!
         x may open door for getting information from manifest / other stuff
   x Cleanly define paths for object creation, especially recursive calls
      x doc/man/cdist-config-layout.text
   x cd $__object_dir, before running manifest
   x rename $__object_dir to $__object_base_dir
   x use $type/manifest instead of $type/init
   x find $object_id in recursive runner (before merge)
   x move parameters of object to subdir parameter
   x run explorers for every object

x generate code to be executed on clients (stage 4)
   x for one object
   x for all objects

x execute code on client (stage 5)

- make cdist run from checkout

- Last doc stuff for 1.0.0:
   x remove old documentation from doc/man/!
   - Check all references in manpages, ensure all manpages exist
      + cdist
      - cdist-deploy-to
      + cdist-manifest
      - cdist-quickstart: how to get started
   - ensure every file in bin/ has a correspondent manpage
   - cdist-type           [IMPORTANT]
      - only do necessary work [TYPE IMPLEMENTATION HINTS]
         - install packages only if not existent
         - copy file only if different
   - cdist-type-integration
   - cdist-explorer

   - DOC document "cd $__object_dir, before running manifest" in doc/man/cdist-types.text
   - DOC document that $type/manifest is executed for every object/instance
   - DOC: exported variables: __type, __explorer, __type_explorer, __object, __object_id

   - Cleanup READMEs
   - Ensure manpages are formatted correctly
   - Ensure html output of manpages are published on the web

- Makefile:
   - Add install target
   - Include manpage generation
